The game is called ProjectDream because that was our alpha game before we actually came up with the name Battle Rooms.

There are not keyboard commands when going into the story mode. You can only play the story mode on the Xbox 360, but all mini games function using the keyboard in some ways be using the arrow keys or WASD.

The latest executable (which is the same one on the xbox) is located in the Executable folder, so you are not required to build the project in order to obtain an executable if you don't want to.

Other than that, enjoy the game!
